# Sequencevol2
A program which:
 Will read the values ​​of three integers a, b, c,
 Will calculate and display the value of the representation (double):
y =
2 * max (a, b) + 3 ∗ gr (a, b, c)
4
where max (a, b) is the function of calculating the maximum of the numbers a and b
and gr (a, b, c) the function of calculating the maximum of three numbers a, b, c. The
reading the three numbers, calculating and displaying the value of the representation will
in the main program, using the max and gr functions that will
implement as functions in C. The result (y) will be displayed to the nearest 2 decimal places.
